# Test-Engine
Nothing too great
I'm trying to learn game engine development, by creating a small 3d game engine.
I don't want to add a lot of things because it's my first engine.
Target :-
    Nice flexible render engine
    a way to manage shader(I always mess this up)
    collision detection (two phase)
    skeletal animation
    shadow mapping
    deffered rendering
    terrain generation using heigh maps
    water rendering
    procedural grass generation
    etc.
It'll be great if you can help me in any way
I do have problems while building the engine such as
    not able to organize the code properly
    messing things up
    hardcoding most of the time
I'm building this engine just for fun and learning, i'm not a master of c++ or opengl, but i understand the concepts and maths of modern 3D
graphics and have read some books on opengl and c++.
Thank you
